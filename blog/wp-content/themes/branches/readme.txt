== Description ==

Branches is a simple, minimalistic magazine/blog theme. It has only a few options but that should be enough. Its fully retina ready and dont need a single image or much additional javascript stuff for the layout itself, so its very lightweight. You can choose between 5 different Fonts and set an individual accent color.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme.
2. Activate the theme.
